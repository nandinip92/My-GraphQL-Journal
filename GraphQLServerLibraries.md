# GraphQL Server Libraries

GraphQL is a **query language and runtime** for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Unlike REST, it prevents over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

However, GraphQL itself is only a **specification**— a set of rules defining how queries, mutations, types, and schemas should work. To use GraphQL in real applications, we need **server implementations** that follow this specification.

These implementations are commonly called:

- GraphQL server libraries

- GraphQL implementations

- Sometimes frameworks for GraphQL

GraphQL Server libraries / implementations handle:

- Parsing and executing GraphQL queries

- Running resolvers to fetch or manipulate data

- Returning the correct response to the client

Different programming languages have their own popular **GraphQL server libraries**, which make it easier to build a GraphQL server without implementing everything from scratch.

## Popular Implementations

### `express-graphql`— for JavaScript/Node.js

- A middleware for Express.js.

- Lightweight and simple → good for learning and small apps.

- Lets you quickly set up a GraphQL endpoint.

**_Use case:_** Quickly set up a GraphQL endpoint in an Express app

**_Example:_**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

const root = { hello: () => "Hello world!" };

const app = express();
app.use("/graphql", graphqlHTTP({ schema, rootValue: root, graphiql: true }));
app.listen(4000);
```

### `apollo-server`— JavaScript/Node.js

- A full-featured GraphQL server for Node.js.

- Provides extra tools: caching, monitoring, federation, subscriptions.

- Widely used in production apps.

**_Use case:_** Building robust, real-world GraphQL apps in Node.js

**_Example:_**

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "Hello world!",
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`));
```

### Graphene— for Python

- A GraphQL library for Python.

- Works well with Django, Flask, or SQLAlchemy.

- Schema is defined using Python classes.

**_Use case:_** Adding GraphQL to Python web apps

**_Example:_** “I’m building a Django/Flask app and want GraphQL instead of REST.”

```python
import graphene

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    hello = graphene.String()

    def resolve_hello(root, info):
        return "Hello world!"

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

```

### `graphql-java`— for Java

- A GraphQL implementation in Java.

- Often used with Spring Boot for enterprise apps.

- Lets you define schema in SDL or Java code.

**_Use case:_** Adding GraphQL to Java backend applications

_**Example use:**_ “I need GraphQL in a Java backend (Spring, enterprise-level apps).”

```java
GraphQLSchema schema = GraphQLSchema.newSchema()
    .query(GraphQLObjectType.newObject()
        .name("Query")
        .field(field -> field
            .name("hello")
            .type(Scalars.GraphQLString)
            .dataFetcher(env -> "Hello world!"))
        .build())
    .build();

GraphQL build = GraphQL.newGraphQL(schema).build();

```

## Do you have to use them?

- Not Mandatory → You can theoretically build a GraphQL server from scratch without using a library.

- In Practice → although you could build from scratch, most developers use libraries because it’s easier, faster, and safer.

Using a GraphQL server library is the standard approach because it:

1. Saves development time – handles core functionality out of the box.

2. Ensures correct implementation of the GraphQL specification.

3. Provides additional features, such as:

   - Monitoring

   - Subscriptions

   - Caching
